# 🚘 Driver Analytics Platform

This project focuses on analyzing real-time vehicle telemetry to enable **AI-powered driver risk scoring** for applications such as insurance, fleet management, and safety monitoring.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this system is to:
- Monitor driver behavior using real-time vehicle data
- Generate AI-based risk scores for each driver
- Help predict incidents and identify risky driving patterns
- Improve operational efficiency through actionable insights and dashboards

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Real-Time Telemetry Ingestion** using scalable ETL pipelines
- **AI-Based Risk Scoring** with structured driver behavior features
- **Streamlit Dashboards** for visualizing incidents, scores, and metrics
- **Delta Lake Architecture** for scalable and reliable data storage

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

                                                                ↓
                                                       Risk Scores & Alerts
                                                       Streamlit Dashboard
```

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Delta Lake + Apache Spark** – for big data processing and scalable storage
- **dbt** – for modeling and transforming telemetry data
- **Airflow** – for orchestrating pipelines and scheduling
- **Streamlit** – for interactive dashboards and monitoring
- **Python** – for data wrangling, scoring logic, and dashboard development

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Integrate LLMs or GPT for incident classification
- Add mobile app interface for fleet operators or insurance agents
- Deploy streaming model inference using Kafka or Flink
